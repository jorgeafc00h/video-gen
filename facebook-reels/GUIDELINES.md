# Facebook Reels Strategy Guidelines

A comprehensive guide for maximizing reach, engagement, and monetization across all three content channels in this pipeline.

## 1. Portrait Composition Rules (9:16)

Facebook Reels is a vertical-first format. Every image and video must be composed with this in mind from the prompt level.

### Core Principles

- **Fill the vertical frame** — the subject should occupy most of the height. Avoid wide horizontal compositions that leave dead space on sides.
- **Center the main subject** — faces, figures, and focal points belong at or near the vertical center. Avoid hard left or right anchoring.
- **Use vertical motion and elements** — lightning striking downward, serpents rising upward, waterfalls cascading, light beams cutting from top to bottom. These naturally guide the eye and feel dynamic in portrait.
- **Sky above, ground below** — compositions that use the full vertical range (sky in the upper third, ground or water in the lower third) read beautifully in Reels.
- **Avoid ultra-wide landscapes** — a mountain range that stretches horizontally reads as wasted space in portrait. Reframe as a single towering peak filling the frame.

### Safe Zones for Text Overlays

Facebook Reels UI elements eat into the frame:

| Zone | Usage |
|---|---|
| Top 10% | Avoid — Facebook UI bar |
| Top 10–25% | Hook text / title overlay safe zone |
| Middle 50% | Primary visual content |
| Bottom 20–35% | Caption preview, CTA buttons, profile info |
| Bottom 10% | Avoid — navigation bar |

Keep the most visually important content in the **middle 50%** of the frame. Text overlays added in post should sit in the top 15–25% zone.

## 2. Hook Writing (First 3 Seconds Are Everything)

Facebook's algorithm rewards watch time. If viewers drop off in the first 3 seconds, the Reel will not be pushed. The hook is the single most important element of any Reel.

### Hook Frameworks

**Curiosity Gap** — hint at something without revealing it:
- "She hid her light... and the world went dark."
- "The gods made a deal they could never undo."

**Dramatic Statement** — open with the most extreme fact:
- "He stole fire from the gods… and paid forever."
- "Every single night, a god fights to bring you the sunrise."

**Question Hook** — pull the viewer into a question they want answered:
- "What happens when the sun god loses?"
- "Which Norse god would you want fighting beside you?"

**Number Hook** — specificity creates credibility:
- "3 minutes before the gods decided humanity's fate."
- "One mistake. One punishment. 10,000 years."

### Hook Rules

- **Keep it under 7 words** if possible — it must be readable in 1–2 seconds as an overlay
- **Never start with "I"** — algorithm de-prioritizes first-person openers on Reels
- **Make it incomplete** — the hook should raise a question the video answers
- **Match the visual** — the hook text should describe exactly what the viewer sees in frame 1

## 3. Caption Strategy

### Short Captions (Under 125 characters)

Best for ambient and nature content where the visual speaks for itself:

- "Let this carry you somewhere peaceful for a moment. 🌿"
- "5000 years ago, they told this story around a fire."

Pros: shows in full without "See more" tap, lower friction.

### Long Captions (150–400 characters)

Best for mythology content where storytelling context increases emotional investment:

- Open with a 1–2 sentence story summary
- Add a specific detail that surprises (the eagle renewed his liver each night)
- Close with a question or CTA

### CTA Placement

- **Always place the CTA at the very end** of the caption, not in the middle
- Use a line break before the CTA to separate it visually
- Best performing CTAs for this content type:
  - "Which [god/myth/character] would you want by your side? 👇"
  - "Save this for when you need a moment of calm 🌿"
  - "Follow — more ancient myths every week"
  - "Comment your answer below 🔥"

## 4. Hashtag Strategy

### Volume

Use **5–10 hashtags** per post. Fewer is better than stuffing — Facebook's algorithm does not reward hashtag walls the way older Instagram behavior did.

### Mix

| Type | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Niche/specific | 2–3 | #NorseMythology, #Amaterasu, #EgyptianMythology |
| Style | 2 | #GhibliArt, #CinematicAI, #AIAnimation |
| Broad reach | 2–3 | #AIArt, #FantasyArt, #MythologyTok |
| Engagement | 1 | #NatureLovers, #RelaxingVideos, #ChillVibes |

### Per Channel

**ghibli_mythology:** #GhibliArt, #AIAnimation, #FantasyArt + myth-specific tags

**realistic_mythology:** #CinematicAI, #AIArt, #AncientHistory + myth-specific tags

**nature_ambient:** #NatureAmbient, #RelaxingVideos, #AmbientVibes, #GhibliArt, #ChillVibes

## 5. Posting Cadence

### Best Times

**Primary window:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday — 7:00–9:00 AM or 7:00–9:00 PM (local audience timezone)

**Secondary window:** Saturday 10:00 AM–12:00 PM

**Avoid:** Monday morning, Friday evening, Sunday night (low organic reach windows for cold audiences)

### Frequency

- **Mythology content:** 3–4x per week. Spacing allows each Reel to accumulate reach before the next one competes.
- **Ambient nature content:** 5–7x per week is acceptable. Ambient loops have consistent evergreen performance and low production cost per post.

### Consistency Over Volume

Posting 4 Reels per week consistently for 8 weeks outperforms posting 20 Reels in 2 weeks then stopping. Facebook's algorithm rewards accounts that maintain regular cadence.

## 6. Audio Recommendations Per Content Type

Audio is the second most important factor (after the hook) for Reel performance. Facebook heavily promotes Reels that use trending audio.

### ghibli_mythology

- Epic orchestral with ethnic instruments (Nordic, Japanese, Egyptian flavors matching the myth)
- Builds from quiet ambient to dramatic swell at the climax moment
- Recommended approach: layer soft ambient music under narration or silence in the first 3s, then bring in music at full at the 4s mark
- Avoid: upbeat pop, lo-fi beats, anything tonally mismatched

### realistic_mythology

- Heavy orchestral, dramatic strings, distant thunder
- Cinematic silence followed by a single percussive hit works extremely well as a hook audio technique
- Avoid: any music that reads as "cute" or "playful" — it kills the serious tone

### nature_ambient

- Soft ambient only — gentle nature sounds (rain, forest, wind), subtle piano or koto
- No drums, no beat drops, no rhythm
- Pure ambient music or nature SFX loops work best
- Facebook rewards long watch times on ambient content — peaceful audio keeps viewers watching on loop

## 7. Engagement Tips

### Reply to Comments Quickly

Facebook's algorithm treats comment replies as engagement signals. Replying within the first 60 minutes of posting dramatically increases reach. Even short replies ("Which myth is next? 👀") re-engage commenters.

### Use Polls and Questions

Facebook Reels supports sticker-style interaction. A simple poll ("Thor or Odin?") in a mythology Reel can triple comment activity. Add polls to every mythology post where possible.

### Pin a Comment

Pin your own comment with a follow-up question or additional story context. This gives viewers something to engage with even after reading the caption.

### Cross-Post to Facebook Groups

After posting, manually share the Reel to relevant Facebook Groups (listed in each `story_info.json` under `suggested_groups`). Group shares are the fastest way to cold-start reach on new accounts.

### Respond to Saves

"Save rate" (saves per view) is the metric Facebook values most for long-term distribution. Encourage saves explicitly: "Save this — you'll want to rewatch it."

## 8. Monetization Notes

### Facebook Reels Play Bonus

Facebook's **Reels Play Bonus** program pays creators based on views earned by eligible Reels within a 30-day window. Requirements and availability vary by region and account eligibility.

- Eligibility: typically requires 1,000+ followers and meeting minimum play thresholds
- Bonus tiers increase with total monthly Reel plays across all qualifying Reels
- Ambient nature content tends to accumulate plays efficiently due to replays and long average watch times

### Brand Deals

The three content channels in this pipeline each have natural brand fit:

| Channel | Brand Categories |
|---|---|
| ghibli_mythology | Fantasy games, anime merchandise, reading apps, art supplies |
| realistic_mythology | History apps, documentary streaming, museums, gaming |
| nature_ambient | Meditation apps, sleep apps, wellness brands, tea/coffee |

Build an audience of 10,000+ before approaching brands directly. Use Facebook's Brand Collabs Manager once eligible.

### Affiliate Opportunities

- Books on mythology (Amazon Associates)
- Art tools and drawing tablets (affiliate programs)
- Meditation and sleep apps (often have affiliate programs with strong CPAs)

## 9. Portrait Prompt Writing Tips for Flux 2 Klein and LTX-2

Writing good portrait prompts is different from standard image generation prompts. These tips apply to all content in this pipeline.

### Always Open With the Style Anchor

Every prompt should begin with the style definition before describing the scene. This anchors the model's style processing before it generates composition.

Examples:
- `Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation,`
- `Hyper-realistic cinematic oil painting, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, portrait orientation,`
- `Cinematic photorealistic rendering, ancient Egyptian aesthetic, dramatic underworld lighting, portrait orientation,`

### Vertical Composition Keywords

Include at least one of these to strongly signal vertical framing:

- `portrait orientation`
- `vertical composition`
- `towering [subject] filling the frame`
- `from sky above to [ocean/earth/abyss] below`
- `[subject] rising from below`
- `[element] descending from above`
- `upper third... lower third` (explicit zone description)

### What to Emphasize for LTX-2 Video Prompts

LTX-2 generates motion from a single frame seed. Video prompts should describe:

1. **What is moving** — be specific (not "motion in the scene" but "Amaterasu's robes billowing upward")
2. **Direction of motion** — upward, downward, spiraling, swaying, cascading
3. **Speed quality** — slow motion, gradual, steady, rhythmic
4. **Secondary motion** — particles, embers, petals, dust motes, ripples (these fill the frame naturally and look excellent in LTX-2)
5. **Camera behavior** — slowly tilting up, camera gently pushing in, wide to medium pull

### What to Avoid in Prompts

- Horizontal panning (wrong axis for portrait)
- Describing audio ("thunderous sound", "roaring ocean") — LTX-2 generates visuals only, audio references confuse the model
- Overly complex multi-subject scenes — one clear subject with environmental detail works better than crowded compositions
- Landscape keywords ("wide vista", "panoramic view", "horizon stretching left and right")

### Color Palette Guidance

| Channel | Palette |
|---|---|
| ghibli_mythology | Soft watercolor blues, greens, golds, warm ambers |
| realistic_mythology | Deep shadows, golden rim light, stark contrast (chiaroscuro) |
| nature_ambient | Soft blues/silvers (night), warm golds (dawn), muted greens (forest), soft pinks (blossoms) |

Including a 2–3 color description at the end of prompts (e.g., "soft blues and silvers, magical and serene") significantly improves color consistency across a series.
