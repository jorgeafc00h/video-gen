Photorealistic cinematic footage, 9:16 vertical frame, extreme low-angle close-up slowly tilting upward along Prometheus's body from iron-shackled bare feet on scorched volcanic rock, past his heaving torso straining against massive rusted chains, up to his scarred outstretched hands reaching toward a blinding column of divine golden fire suspended above in roiling storm clouds, his fingers trembling inches from the flame, veins visible on his forearms, sweat catching the firelight, muscles locked in full exertion, slow camera tilt continuing upward past his reaching hands into the blazing divine light, orange embers drifting downward past his face, hair whipping in the electric wind, deep chiaroscuro with black void below and searing gold above, photorealistic skin texture, cinematic grain, anamorphic lens flare

Photorealistic cinematic footage, 9:16 vertical frame, medium close-up of Prometheus chained spread-eagle against a sheer black cliff face, camera locked and slightly handheld, his chest rising and falling in rapid exhausted breaths, wrists raw and bleeding where iron shackles bite into skin, his head snapping upward as the massive shadow of the eagle falls across him from above, the shadow sweeping down the cliff face like a curtain, the sound of enormous wings causing his hair and tattered cloth to blast downward, his expression shifting from exhaustion to absolute dread, pupils dilating, teeth clenching, the eagle's talons entering frame from the top edge descending toward him in sharp focus, storm-grey sky churning behind, cold desaturated light broken only by the iron sheen of the chains, photorealistic detail on feathers and metal
