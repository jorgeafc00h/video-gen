Photorealistic cinematic footage, 9:16 vertical frame, slow descending crane shot following Ra's solar barque from above as it moves downward through absolute pitch-black underworld, the barque the only source of warm amber-gold light in total void, Ra standing at the prow in full falcon-headed god armor gripping his was-scepter in both hands, his head slowly turning left then right scanning the darkness with disciplined military vigilance, the golden hull cutting through black water that barely reflects the light, hieroglyphs on the hull pulsing and dimming rhythmically, dark formless silhouettes barely visible at the extreme edges of the light radius retreating as the barque passes, the darkness closing silently behind, absolute silence except for water displacement, wide pupils adjusting shot as Ra's gaze fixes on something below, deep black with isolated warm gold, photorealistic scale and material detail
Photorealistic cinematic footage, 9:16 vertical frame, the black water below the barque suddenly erupting violently upward as Apep's colossal body bursts through the surface, camera holding locked as the serpent's body fills the lower half of the frame and keeps rising, each scale the size of a shield catching the barque's light in corrupted dark-teal phosphorescence, black water cascading off the scales in sheets, the sheer mass of the body causing visible displacement waves rocking the barque, Ra immediately shifting his stance wide and raising his scepter, the serpent's single amber-red eye rotating slowly into frame and locking directly on the camera with predatory intelligence, vertical motion continuing as more coils rise and rise filling the frame, Apep's open jaw visible above, forked tongue slowly extending, photorealistic scale texture with subsurface light scattering, absolute black background broken only by the eye's glow and barque's gold
Photorealistic cinematic footage, 9:16 vertical frame, intense handheld medium shot of Ra planting his back foot on the prow and driving his was-scepter downward with full force, the moment of strike releasing a vertical column of blinding white divine light from the staff tip that punches straight down through the frame, the light column expanding as it descends and striking Apep's body, the serpent's scales blackening and peeling away at the contact point, its body recoiling violently downward in convulsive spasms, the massive form retreating and shrinking back into the black water below, waves of residual divine light washing outward and briefly illuminating the underworld walls before fading, Ra holding his stance without expression as the chaos recedes beneath him, then slowly lowering the scepter as the light fades, the water stilling, darkness closing back in perfectly calm, divine gold at Ra's crown against absolute black, photorealistic volumetric light shafts
