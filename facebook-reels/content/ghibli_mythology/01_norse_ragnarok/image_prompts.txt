Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, Thor standing tall at the summit of a storm-swept mountain, hammer raised high, dramatic storm clouds churning in the upper half of the frame, jagged lightning crackling vertically downward from above, wind whipping his red cape upward, warriors silhouetted far below in the mist, epic scale emphasizing his solitary height against the sky, deep indigo and electric gold palette, painterly soft edges
Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, Jormungandr the world serpent rising dramatically from the churning dark ocean depths below, massive scaled coils spiraling upward through the vertical frame, each coil larger than mountains, bioluminescent green eyes glowing in the dark water, turbulent black waves at the bottom of the frame, the serpent's head reaching toward storm clouds at the top, deep blacks and teal-greens with pale foam highlights, awe-inspiring vertical spiral composition
Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, the Bifrost rainbow bridge shattering in a cascade of prismatic light, broken fragments of the bridge falling vertically downward through the center of the frame, Norse gods and Asgardian warriors tumbling in slow motion within the column of falling light, golden Asgard structures crumbling at the top of the frame, dark void and stars visible below as the rainbow light dissolves into fragments, rich golds and violets bleeding into darkness, dreamlike painterly quality
