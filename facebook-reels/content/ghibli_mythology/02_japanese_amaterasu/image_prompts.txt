Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, the sealed entrance of Ama-no-Iwato cave viewed from below, complete darkness filling the lower portion of the frame, jagged volcanic rock framing the scene from top edges, a gathering of Japanese gods and celestial beings clustered on a narrow stone ledge above the cave mouth, paper lanterns glowing warmly, cedar trees silhouetted at the very top, deep blacks and warm amber lantern light against the darkness, reverent and tense atmosphere
Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, a single shaft of golden divine light piercing downward from the top of the frame through the darkness of the cave interior, dust motes and cherry blossom petals spiraling slowly downward within the beam, the cave walls faintly visible in warm gold on either side of the beam, Amaterasu's luminous silhouette faintly visible at the very top of the beam as a source of radiance, inky cave darkness pressing in from both sides, magical contrast of gold light against deep shadow
Studio Ghibli anime watercolor illustration, portrait orientation, Amaterasu the sun goddess ascending through parting clouds, robes of white and gold billowing upward around her as she rises, her form filling the upper two-thirds of the frame, golden radiant light blazing outward from her in all directions illuminating clouds below, cherry blossom petals caught in the updraft spiraling upward alongside her, warm golds and soft whites against a pale dawn sky, her expression serene and triumphant, painterly loose watercolor edges
